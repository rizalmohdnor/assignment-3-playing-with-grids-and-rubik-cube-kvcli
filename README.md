by 

**NAME**: Abdulaziz Aljaadi

**Matric ID** 2029443

## Objective

This app simulates a 2x2 Rubik's Cube, allowing users to rotate its faces in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The cube consists of six color-coded faces (Top, Bottom, Front, Back, Left, Right), and users can interact with the app by rotating these faces through buttons. The app provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize and manipulate a 2x2 Rubik's Cube in a Flutter environment.
